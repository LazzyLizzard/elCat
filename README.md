A React-Redux front-end solution for pretty much modified osCommerce engine.

### Important notice

Please keep in mind that this is a **very raw** "pet project" code that leaves much to be improved. For example, there's a great lack of poroptypes check etc.

The base purpose of this project is self-study and learning of something new.
